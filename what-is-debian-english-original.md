The Universal Operating System

What is Debian GNU/Linux?

Debian is a free operating system for your computer. Debian is currently based on the Linux kernel and includes more than 51,000 packages of utilities and applications. This is far more software than is available for any other Free operating system. Ten architectures and variants are supported, including 32-bit and 64-bit PCs. Since 1993, volunteer developers (currently more than 1,000) are working on maintaining Debian's high quality.

Freedom As stated in the Debian Social Contract, Debian is comprised entirely of Free Software. By Free Software, we don't just mean zero cost, but also the Freedom to use it how and where you want, share it with your friends, read and modify the source code, and distribute those changes to other people.

Continuity The Debian package system permits a seamless transition to newer program versions without the requirement to begin a new installation from scratch, and it won't delete your old configuration files. Dependencies between programs are handled automatically: if a package which you want to install requires another package, the installer takes care of it. You can install and upgrade using BluRay discs, DVDs, CDROMs, USB sticks, or using a network connection, whatever suits you best.

Security Debian is secure by default, and easily adjustable in case of really extreme security demands. It is easy to install a Debian system with just very little software. When a security problem is found, the Debian Security Team releases packages with backported security fixes, generally within 48 hours. With the help of the Debian package management system, it is therefore easy even for an inexperienced administrator to keep up to date with security. This service is available to anyone for free.

Quality Thanks to the personal commitment of Debian developers, package quality is unequalled. Keeping this standard up is furthermore helped by the Debian Policy Manual, which describes exactly how packages should behave and interact with the system. A package which violates the policy will not be included in the official stable Debian release. Another aid in quality assurance is the open Debian bug tracking system. Debian does not hide problems. Debian has no commercial pressure and will not release a new and possibly unstable version just because the market requires it.

Included with Debian GNU/Linux

The complete Debian GNU/Linux distribution consists of at least 12 DVDs, or 3 BDs. These discs hold just the architecture-dependent precompiled binaries; the sources are available on separate media.
Inside you'll find:

- the full set of GNU utilities, editors (Emacs, vi,...) network clients (chat, filesharing,...), web browsers (including Chromium, as well as Firefox and other Mozilla products), privacy tools (gpg, ssh, ...email clients, and every little tool you can think of;

  - full set of network protocols (IPv4, IPv6, PPP, SMB network neighbourhood);

  - development tools for major programming languages like C, C++, C#, Objective-C, Java, Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby and many of the more obscure ones as well;

  - the graphical X Windows System, complete with dozens of window managers and the leading desktops: GNOME, MATE, KDE, cinnamon, XFCE and LXDE.

  - the TEX/LATEX document preparation system, PostScript TM, and Type1 fonts and tools, the Ghostscript PostScript TM interpreter, and a complete XML/SGML/HTML development environment;

  - GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program (a free alternative to Photoshop TM);

  - a complete set of office applications, including the LibreOffice productivity suite, Gnumeric and other spreadsheets, WYSIWYG editors, calendars;

  - relational databases, like PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and development tools (application servers, server side scripting languages)

To install Debian GNU/Linux, you can download a single CD from http://www.debian.org/distrib/ and use it to start a network install; or order (or burn) some Debian DVDs/CDs. Debian does not sell media itself, but provides Official DVD/CD images that numerous vendors print and sell. For details about the Official DVD/CD images simply go to http://www.debian.org/CD/.
